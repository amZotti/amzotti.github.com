<h1>Why you need to Learn Algorithms</h1>
<p>I was in the final stages of creating a JSON parser yesterday and needed help
with a few aspects of it. I went into an WebDev IRC channel to ask
questions.
I asked questions regarding escape characters and someone replied, "What
are you using this for?". I told this inquisitive user that I am making a JSON parser for learning
purposes. He replied, <blockquote>"That's stupid, those already exist. I have been a
developer for eight years and never needed to know that"</blockquote>. I was a little let
down, but not at all surprised.</p>

<p>This reminded me of a similar experience at Harvard when I took a data
structures and algorithms class. One student in class remarked that 
they don't get why they had to learn algorithms. I began thinking,
<blockquote>"Why DO we need to learn algorithms?"</blockquote>. I began asking
this question, and when you ask a question with consistency, you tend to get
answers with consistency.</p>

<h2>The Purpose of Learning Algorithms</h2>
<p>The reason it is valuable to learn CS fundamentals like algorithms and
computational theory is because it teaches you how
to think dynamically. When people
first learn programming syntax they pretty much have a few basic design patterns they use
over and over again. Usually just lumping a series of for-loops and if
statements together. It's kind of like playing a video game with someone and having
your opponent just be a 'button masher'. That is, only knowing two moves nad pressing the same button over
and over that makes them do those moves. When you learn how to build more complex things, many
times those basic patterns don't work anymore. You can't create QuickSort or
a JSON parser by arranging a series of for loops and if statements in just the
right sequence. These challenges require a higher level of thinking. They
require you to hold multiple ideas in your head simultaneously and organize
them in unique ways. And they also require thinking about one problem on multiple levels of
abstraction.</p>

<h2>The Results of Learning Algorithms</h2>
<p>Okay so I mentioned the reason, but what about the effect? Is learning
algorithms and computational theory actually useful? In my experience solving problems that required computational
theory, algorithms, and data structures has really accelerated my learning
curve. It taught me how to multitask while problem solving and organize my code
better.
Furthermore it taught me to think on multiple levels of abstraction. It also really honed my
concentration skills. Solving complex problems requires very deep
concentration for an extended period of time. Finally, it really increased my
confidence in my ability to program. Which helped me blast through the mental
barriers of what I thought I couldn't do.</p>
