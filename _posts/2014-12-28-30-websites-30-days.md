<h1>30 websites in 30 days</h1>
<p>In any particular skillset, there is the distinction to be made regarding the
difference between depth and breadth of skill. Breadth concerns the range and
diversity of knowledge you have. Depth concerns the level of internalization you
have attained. After taking Harvard's Data Structures  and Algorithms class I
determined that depth was by far more important than breadth. This class was the
most intense course I have ever taken in my life. This single course was
basically a part time job, with each homework assignment taking the average
student between 20-30 hours.</p>

<p> After I completed finals for the semester, I went
off and began doing other challenges in my spare time during Christmas break
such as completing <a
href="https://github.com/amZotti/javascript-koans">JavaScript koans</a> and
rewriting <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a>. I realized
while doing these other projects just how much I learned in class. I was able to
come up with solutions that before the class I would have never been able to
come up with. And yet interestingly enough, none of the content was similar in
syntax or form. It
wasn't that I simply attained more knowledge, rather it was more so that I had
internalized universal fundamentals of software engineering at a deep level. <b>The
principles I have mastered are now spilling over into all areas of my work and
allow me to produce greater results than I ever thought possible.</b></p>

<p>Depth is more powerful than breadth because depth is universal. It is not
universal in content, but rather it is universal in the underlying forms and
patterns. For example, when you learn enough programming languages, learning
another one is just a matter of learning new syntax. When you have already
internalized the fundamentals of object oriented programming, you have mastered
that set of patterns, so switching programming languages is as easy as learning
new syntax.</p>

<p>The tendency in humans is to pursue breadth over depth. Humans want breadth over depth for one fundamental reason:
Human's are biologically programmed to preserve time and energy. Going for depth
is usually more difficut; it is easier to learn new material than to internalize
your current knowledge base at a much deeper level. The reason breadth is more
enticing is because our brains crave variety and novelty.</p>

<h2>How is any of this relevant?</h2>
<p>I have an entire month off before going to my next <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/">intensive software engineering school</a>. When people get timeoff they usually take it easy, because as stated above- our biological tendency is to perserve time and energy. I am going to use this time off as an oppurtunity to defy my evolutionary programming, and spend the entire month coding my own projects.</p>

<h2>Massive Action Plan</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/amZotti/oneWebsiteADay">Make one static
website a day for 30 days</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/amZotti/amzotti.github.com">Make one blog post
every other day for 30 days</a></li>
</ol>

<br>
<p>So that's it! That is my new personal standard for this month. A lot of people of neat ideas, but without following your cool ideas up with action they are pretty pointless.</p>
