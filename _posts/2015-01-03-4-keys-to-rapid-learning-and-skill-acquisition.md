<h1>4 Keys to Rapid Learning and Skill Acquisition</h1>

<ol>
<li>
<h3>Recognize Paradigms</h3>
<p>It is human nature to draw comparisons between what is new and what is
familiar. This methodology of learning through comparisons allows humans
to learn very quickly.
However, if someone is constantly learning through comparisons then what happends when
they are trying to learn something that is unlike anything they have seen
before? Learning through comparisons has the potential to be ineffective, or
even harmful. This is especially true in computer science where solutions to problems
require not only more information, but different systems of thinking altogether.
Different solutions require different systems of thinking.
<h4><blockquote>
"Problems cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them" -
Einstein
</blockquote></h4>
Trying to compare new information with something you already know has the
potential to lead to misunderstandings.</p>

<p>It has been said, <b>"When you are programming in Java, program in Java. When you
are programming in Ruby, program in Ruby"</b>.  What this essentially means is, 
do not transfer a paradigm of thinking from one
context into another. Programming in Java requires a system of thinking that is
different than programming in Ruby. Each language has a different system of thinking because each
language serves a different purpose. Technicalities become simple when
fundamentals are in the blood. </p>

<p>Recognize that when you are learning something new that you may have to learn
a new system of thinking.</p>

<h3> Maintain Beginners Mind </h3>

<p>It is the natural tendency of humans to associate their identity with the
activity where they spend their time. Since programming is very time consuming, developers
tend to have a good deal of their sense of self invested in their work. This may
have the
positive benefit of motivating individuals to work hard to become more skilled.
On the other hand, it has the potential negative effect of causing people to
compare themselves to others. Comparisons are dangerous because once someone decides
they know more than someone else they unconsciously close themselves off from
learning anything from others.</p>

<p>Have the beginners mind: assume there is always more to learn.
I now have the attitude that <b>if I attend a lecture, read a book, or watch a
video- even if I only learn one new thing, it is worth it</b>. Even if I hear or
watch something I already know at least it reinforces my current knowledge even
 deeper. Repition is the mother of skill.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Be kind and patient towards yourself</h3>
<p>Everybody has days where they have performed poorly, and everyone has days where
they performed great. It is easy to slip into a role of identifying with your
skill level and saying, <i>"I am intermediate at x skill"</i>, but the truth is your
skill level on any paticular day is highly variable. You are as bad as your worst 
day and you as are good as your best day. You are only human, and despite others
best efforts to appear special or gifted most humans learn at pretty much the same
rate, differing only in learning style. The world will never cease to provide evidence to
you that you are inferrior to others. Do not buy into the idea that other people
are more gifted than you in a paticular area. Nobody is special. Nobody is above
the process. There are no shortcuts to skill development. Massive action is
king. So remember your ABC's: <b>Always Be Coding</b>.
</ul>


<li>
<h3>Realize your potential</h3>
<p>The human brain is the most powerful
computer on the planet. It has the backing of 40+ millions of years of
evolution. The human brain is capable
of mastering any skill if given enough time and resources. <b>The potential for any
person for any given skill is absolute Mastery</b>. For some it may take longer
based on their learning style and motivation levels, but
the <b>potential is the same regardless of personality, characte traits, or
personal history</b>.</p>
