<h1>The Power of Goal Setting</h1>
<p>Goal setting is like magic. There has never been a year where I have set goals and then not have achieved them. This is not a statement about how great I am, it is a statement of how amazing the human brain is. The human brain is essentially a goal seeking machine. When we have goals it makes us feel alive and fulfilled; it gives us the sense that we are really making progress in life. I believe the purpose of a goal is not to achieve the goal, the purpose of a goal is what it makes us as human beings.</p>

<h2>How to Follow Through with Goals</h2>
<p>I think the most potent way to keep on track in your goals is to make them public. Making your goals public makes you more emotionally invested. Once you tell other people about your goals there is no going back. </p>
